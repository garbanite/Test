                Appdb does not have so much real devices to activate iCloud accounts for everyone who uses PRO.<br/><br/>
                And that's why we are asking you to help us to activate our account on your device. It will use one iCloud activation for current year for your device, but who uses more than 2 Apple IDs on the same device?<br/><br/>
